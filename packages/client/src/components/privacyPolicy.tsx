          choices we offer California residents regarding our handling of their personal information.
        </p>
        <h2>CCPA Scope and Exclusions</h2>
        <p>
          This CCPA Notice, including the description of our Privacy Practices and your Privacy Rights, apply only to
          California residents whose interactions with us are limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li>

            which are subject to the notice set forth in the Additional Disclosure section of this Policy.; or

        </ul>
        <h2>Privacy Practices</h2>
        <p>
          We do not “sell” the personal information we collect (as such term is defined in the CCPA) for monetary value
          (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). Like many companies, we may use third-party
          cookies for our advertising purposes. If you would like to learn how you may opt out of our use of cookies and
          other tracking technologies, please review the instructions provided in the Online Tracking Opt-out Guide
          section of this Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>The CCPA grants individuals the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information. You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your personal
            information during the past 12 months. For details about the personal information we have collected over the
            last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the What We Collect section of this Policy.
            We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How We Use Information
            section of this Policy. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the How
            We Share and Disclose Information section of this Policy.
          </li>
          <li>Access. You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.</li>
          <li>Deletion. You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive
          information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a
          deletion request. We will also respond to requests for information and access only to the extent we are able
          to associate with a reasonable effort the information we maintain with the identifying details you provide in
          your request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you. You are entitled to exercise
          the rights described above free from discrimination.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Submit a Request</h2>
        <p>To request access to or deletion of personal information to admin@freeartists.dao.</p>
        <h2>Identity Verification</h2>
        <p>
          The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete
          personal information before providing a substantive response to the request. We will ask you to verify your
          identity when you submit a request.
        </p>
        <h2>Authorized Agents</h2>
        <p>
          California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the
          authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as the "Shine the Light" law) permits consumers who are
          California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the
          categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the
          preceding calendar year to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Our disclosure
          requirements apply only if we share our consumers’ personal information with third parties for them to
          directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own business. If you
          are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us as provided in the "Contact Us"
          section below.
