You may send us an email to request access to, correct, or remove any personal information that you have provided to us.

7.California Privacy Rights.
We are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) to provide this CCPA Notice to California residents to explain how we collect, use and share their personal information, and the rights and choices we offer California residents regarding our handling of their personal information.

CCPA Scope and Exclusions
This CCPA Notice, including the description of our Privacy Practices and your Privacy Rights, apply only to California residents whose interactions with us are limited to:

Visiting our consumer websites; and
signing up for email alerts.
This CCPA Notice does not apply to the personal information we collect, use or disclose about:

individuals who provide information to us to initiate or complete the process of trading on our platform, which are subject to the notice set forth in the Additional Disclosure section of this Policy.; or
representatives of businesses that seek to obtain our products or services, or to provide products or services to us.
Privacy Practices
We do not “sell” the personal information we collect (as such term is defined in the CCPA) for monetary value (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). Like many companies, we may use third-party cookies for our advertising purposes. If you would like to learn how you may opt out of our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, please review the instructions provided in the Online Tracking Opt-out Guide section of this Policy.

Privacy Rights
The CCPA grants individuals the following rights:

Information. You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared your personal information during the past 12 months. For details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the What We Collect section of this Policy. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How We Use Information section of this Policy. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the How We Share and Disclose Information section of this Policy.
Access. You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.
Deletion. You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.
Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. We will also respond to requests for information and access only to the extent we are able to associate with a reasonable effort the information we maintain with the identifying details you provide in your request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.

How to Submit a Request
To request access to or deletion of personal information to admin@goldfinch.finance.

Identity Verification
The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the request. We will ask you to verify your identity when you submit a request.

Authorized Agents
California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have a written authorization confirming that authority.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as the "Shine the Light" law) permits consumers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Our disclosure requirements apply only if we share our consumers’ personal information with third parties for them to directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own business. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us as provided in the "Contact Us" section below.

8.How We Protect Your Information.
We take reasonable precautions to secure your personal information. We have implemented technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your information. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.

The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist safeguarding your personal information, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website or any other Services.

If you choose to visit the Services, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Use (https://app.goldfinch.finance/terms), including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Delaware.
