        Longtime friends Joe Smith and Chaz D. (DJ Chaz) left their small
        Northern Illinois town to pursue music. After moving to opposide sides
        of the country, DJ Chaz worked as a solo artist as Joe opened and
        performed on several music tours. Years later, they reunited to jam on
        their hometown stage. Within hours, they had a foundation for a new
        project: a collaborative 5-track EP calling for all other Northern
        Illinois musicians. Check out Joeâ€™s video for an exclusive look into the
        making of Techno Collab, the next best sound from the most unique
        artists in Northern Illinois!
