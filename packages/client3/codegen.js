// ! IMPORTANT: In case of emergency where our subgraph goes down due to error, this codegen step will fail.
// ! Since this codegen step is part of app builds, deployment and development will fail (the existing app in production should be OK, it uses non-fatal subgraph errors).
// ! The most straightforward solution is to fix the subgraph error, but if you need to develop/deploy the app in the meantime, you can take these temporary countermeasures:
// ! If you only need to make your local dev work:
// ! 1. Change NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL in .env.local to a working version of the most recent subgraph. This can be localhost if you're running it. Codegen will now work again for local dev
// ! If you need prod deployments to work:
// ! 1. Same as step 1 above
// ! 2. `npm run codegen-introspection` - Now you'll have an up-to-date introspection result at ./lib/graphql/schema.json
// ! 3. Remove `lib/graphql/schema.json` from .gitignore, then change `schema` below to use that local file instead of a remote URL (check the comment below)
// ! 4. Commit the schema.json file and the change to `schema` in this file. Remote builds will now work again because the types are being generated off schema.json
// ! UNDO THE ABOVE STEPS ONCE THE SUBGRAPH IS WORKING AGAIN. schema.json is an auto-generated file and it'll show up in diffs all the time which is annoying
